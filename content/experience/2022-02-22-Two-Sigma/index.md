After my great internship experience, I decided to join back full-time with
Two Sigma!

Unfortunately, I cannot share much about the work that I currently do at Two
Sigma as we deal with a lot of secure IP, but here's the gist. I am currently
working as a data engineer at the company. As a data engineer, I deal with the
various different types of datasets that the company ingests for its models
and eventually trading. These datasets need to be appropriately parsed,
arbitrated, and cleaned so that it can be used by the different consumers
within the company.
