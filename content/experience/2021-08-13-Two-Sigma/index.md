Unfortunately, I cannot share much about the work that I did as part of my
internship because Two Sigma is a high security finance company.

Every FinTech company has financial simulations, that is an open secret. I
worked on a project to measure the robustness and precision of the financial
simulations. I designed reports that display the results of the analyses
performed on the financial simulations using Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib
for swift analysis and plot generation.

The process was fully automated using internal tools, and Jinja was used for
rendering the reports using HTML templating. The reports can be easily
accessed by engineers and modelers at Two Sigma and can potentially have
many use cases in the future.
