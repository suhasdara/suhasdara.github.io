As a Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Austin, the
first two courses that I had taken were CS312 (Intro to Programming) and
CS314 (Data Structures). These courses are taught by, and have been taught by
[Professor Michael Scott](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/michael-scott)
for a really long time. He is one of the best instructors I have had and the
fundamentals I learned from him have molded the approaches I take to
problem-solving.

As a student, I often spent a lot of time in the Gates-Dell Complex
([GDC](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/campus/buildings/nlogon/maps/UTM/GDC/))
lab where the office hours for the intro CS courses were conducted and a lot
of other students also find themselves. I often helped other students in
subtle ways to work on their projects while the Teaching Assistants were
overwhelmed by the number of students seeking help. Once I completed these
courses, I felt an urge to be a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the
[CS314 course](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs314/index.htm) myself.

I was a TA for the CS314 course for two semesters. This came with a few
different responsibilities. I was fully responsible for a discussion section
of around 25 students each semester. This included conducting a teaching
recap session once every week, conducting mandatory quizzes during these
sessions, and grading the quizzes and weekly programming assignments of this
batch of students. Additionally, I was responsible for conducting three
hours of office hours a week, which are first-come-first-serve help sessions
for all the students enrolled in the course. Lastly, I helped grade the
exams of the students three times a semester.

Grading the weekly programming assignments was a mix of automated scripts
created by the professor and former TAs, along with manual inspection of
coding style and approach.

The assignments were to be graded on the lab computers for consistency across
all submissions. As a student who was now in upper level courses and much more
rarely visiting the lab, this was becoming quite an ordeal. One of the main
contributions I made to the TA ecosystem while I was a TA was to create a
set of scripts that could be used by TAs working with Unix-derivative personal
systems to remotely execute the scripts on the submissions and then retrieve
the results of the scripts back to their personal computer for manual grading.
These scripts, which can be found
[here](https://github.com/suhasdara/easy_grader), were quite a useful tool and
other TAs started using them as well. I have received messages from some of
the more recent TAs thanking me for the scripts!

Overall, I enjoyed this experience, which kept my brain active with the
data structures knowledge, introduced me to a lot of students, and acted
as bonus prep for internship interviews!
