I did not have experience with any languages other\\nthan Java. Before starting, my manager revealed that the project would be a\\nweb development project, and I used it as an opportunity to learn some\\nlanguages and skills early on. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript,\\nand ReactJS in the weeks before my internship. In fact, one of my projects\\n(\", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"/projects/type-or-die\"\n  }, \"a typing game\"), \") was a result of this learning\\nexperience.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"At Qualys, my project was to develop a completely new, standalone UI to load\\ntest the Qualys cloud platform's Passive Sensor (PS) microservice. While the\\nscripts to generate and run the actual load testing queries and HTTP requests\\nwas being developed by a different part of the team in Node.js, my project\\nwas to integrate a frontend UI that made load testing a task that has easily\\ninterpretable and visual results.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I first developed a server using ExpressJS and Node.js that tended to the\\nfrontend UI, and also received inputs from the load testing scripts. For the\\nfrontend itself, I used native HTML, CSS, and ReactJS to create a single-page\\nweb UI. The frontend communicated with the server using WebSockets as opposed\\nto HTTP requests. This was a crucial design choice moving forward because\\nload testing tends to generate a lot of data that needs to be parsed and\\ndisplayed continuously in the UI.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The webapp was developed to show the same results and view to multiple users.\\nData in form fields, progress data, and any other data that was displayed\\nthrough the UI was shared across all instances of the webapps through the\\nuse of WebSockets. This meant that only a single load test could be run at a\\ngiven time but everyone could access the progress and results live.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The UI had a few different screens: a form to kick off load testing scripts,\\na display page that showed the test's progression, and a dashboard that\\ndisplayed historic results through charts using highcharts.js. The webapp\\nwas designed to have long-term storage of results and also the initial form\\nconfigurations using MongoDB. However, the webapp also had an \\\"offline\\\" mode\\nwhen it was not connected to the database. This mode allowed starting load\\ntesting but without some functionality: saved form configurations could not\\nbe used, the results would not be saved to the database, and the dashboard to\\nview historic charts could not be accessed.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"While developing a system to receive data in the server and propagate it\\nto the UI, I hit a dependency roadblock of designing and implementing a\\nmutual config for how the data would be formatted and what all data would be\\nprovided by the scripts. I helped the other team in overcoming these\\nroadblocks and in the process, I learned about multi-processing for the\\nfirst time. Additionally, I implemented a multi-process queue in Node.js that\\nwas shared by the processes in the load testing scripts and the server as\\nwell. This allowed a seamless transfer of data without any additional network\\nrequests.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Towards the end of my internship, another team noticed my work and asked\\nif a similar web interface could be implemented for the load testing of\\nthe Network Access Control (NAC) appliance. I modified the server interface\\nof the webapp to receive network traffic from a UDP socket instead of the\\ndata from the PS load testing scripts. Minor changes to the UI and database\\nallowed for a fully functioning framework for the NAC appliance's testing\\nas well. Working with the other team gave me some basic insight about\\ncommand-line networking tools such as netstat, netcat, tcpdump, and\\nwireshark.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Overall, it was a very fruitful internship in which I learned about a lot\\nof web development tools and languages, and also got an opportunity to work\\non the actual load testing scripts that provided the data to the UI. As a\\nbonus, I learned some OS and networking concepts a lot before I was formally\\nintroduced to them at University.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","frontmatter":{"title":"Qualys Internship","company":"Qualys","companyLink":"https://www.qualys.com/","startDates":["2018-06-18T00:00:00.000Z"],"endDates":["2018-08-17T00:00:00.000Z"],"languages":["HTML","CSS","JavaScript"],"tools":["ReactJS","ExpressJS","Node.js","MongoDB","WebSocket"],"slug":"/experience/qualys","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/a7048fd15297150f133269c9a21c2bcb/7e7e9/featured.png","srcSet":"/static/a7048fd15297150f133269c9a21c2bcb/5db04/featured.png 75w,\n/static/a7048fd15297150f133269c9a21c2bcb/6d161/featured.png 150w,\n/static/a7048fd15297150f133269c9a21c2bcb/7e7e9/featured.png 225w","sizes":"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{}},
