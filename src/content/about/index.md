Hello! I'm **Suhas Dara**!

I grew up in Pune, India. I graduated high school at the age of 15 and decided to take a break before I tackled college. During the gap year, I experienced the joy of programming for the first time, and I realized it is my future. I majored in Computer Science at **The University of Texas at Austin** and received my Bachelor's in 2021. After a few years in the fintech industry at **Two Sigma**, I decided to go back to school at **Purdue University** for a Master's in ECE to focus on the confluence of Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence.

I enjoy working on new projects and learning new technologies. I also enjoy making my life easier by integrating AI into several facets of my day-to-day. Using new programming languages and finding differences between them provides me satisfaction. I have dabbled in web and mobile development, data engineering, ML, DL, AI, and a lot more, but I am always striving to find my next interest.
