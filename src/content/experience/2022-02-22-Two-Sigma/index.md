After my great internship experience, I decided to join back full-time with
Two Sigma!

Unfortunately, I cannot share much about the work that I did at Two
Sigma as we dealt with a lot of secure IP, but here's the gist. I worked
as a data engineer at the company on a team called Foundational Data
Engineering (FDE). On FDE, we processed various types of fundamental datasets
including different asset classes like stocks, bonds, options, futures, and
other derivatives. Reference data and pricing data for these assets are
equally important for the company to train, simulate, and eventually
deploy models in production. These datasets need to be appropriately parsed,
arbitrated, and cleaned into a company-wide agreed format since the data
comes from lots of different vendors and the data can be used by the
multiple consumers within the company.

I helped maintain and migrate older data pipelines to newer architectures by
using tools such as Ibis and Pandas to manipulate and serve large datasets in
BigQuery. This architecture became one of the newer standards in the team. 
As a result, I became quite comfortable with SQL in general while working with
both SQL Server and BigQuery during my stint at Two Sigma.
